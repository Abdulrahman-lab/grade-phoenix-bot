## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL (recommended for production)
- Telegram Bot Token

---

## Environment Variables
Set these in your Railway dashboard or `.env` file:
- `TELEGRAM_TOKEN` â€” Your Telegram bot token (required)
- `ADMIN_ID` â€” Telegram user ID of the admin (required)
- `DATABASE_URL` â€” PostgreSQL connection string (recommended)
- `BOT_VERSION` â€” Bot version string (optional, default: dev)
- `GRADE_CHECK_INTERVAL` â€” Interval (in minutes) for grade checks (default: 15)
- (Other variables as needed in `config.py`)

---

## Setup & Deployment
### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd telegram_university_bot
```
### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 3. Configure Environment Variables
Set the required variables in Railway's dashboard or a `.env` file.
### 4. Deploy to Railway
- Push your code to GitHub and connect your repository to Railway.
- Railway will automatically build and deploy your bot using the `Procfile`.
- Migrations are run automatically before the bot starts.
### 5. Local Development
To run locally:
```bash
python migrations.py  # Run migrations (optional if using Railway)
python main.py        # Start the bot
```

---

## Usage
- Users interact with the bot via Telegram to register, check grades, and receive notifications.
- Admins access the dashboard for analytics, user management, and broadcasting.

---

## Admin Features
- **Dashboard:** View user stats, grade analytics, and recent activity.
- **User Management:** Search, view, and delete users (deletion cascades to grades).
- **Broadcast:** Send messages to all users.
- **Security:** Only the admin (as set by `ADMIN_ID`) can access admin features.

---

## Grade Notification Logic
- The bot checks for grade changes every `GRADE_CHECK_INTERVAL` minutes.
- Only changed courses are notified to the user, with both old and new values shown.
- Notifications are sent in the user's preferred language.

---

## Database & Migrations
- Uses SQLAlchemy models for database schema.
- Migrations are handled by `migrations.py` and run automatically on Railway.
- Grade deletion is cascaded when a user is deleted (ON DELETE CASCADE).

---

## Testing
- Unit tests are provided for storage modules.
- Run all tests with:
```bash
pytest
```
