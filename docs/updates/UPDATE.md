### July 2025 Update: Quote & Translation System (Revised)

- Quotes are always fetched in English and translated to Arabic for all users.
- Translation is performed using googletrans, now configured with `service_urls` and `user_agent` as per the official documentation.
- Strict debugging logs and error handling are implemented for translation attempts.
- Translation reliability depends on Google and the maintenance of the googletrans library. Persistent errors may require checking your library version or switching to the official API.
- **All notifications, broadcasts, and grade messages (current, past, and updates) now include a dual-language motivational quote, always wrapped in double quotes.**
- **The button and keyboard system is robust, covers all user flows (registration, error recovery, admin, settings, notifications, broadcasts), and uses both reply and inline keyboards for optimal UX.**
- **Translation tests are skipped if the API is blocked (403), so test results reflect only actual code issues.**
- **The daily quote broadcast time is now configurable via the `QUOTE_SCHEDULE` environment variable.**
  - Format: `HH:MM` (24-hour, e.g., `09:30`, `18:00`)
  - Timezone: Always UTC+3 (Asia/Riyadh)
  - If not set or invalid, defaults to `14:00` (2pm UTC+3)
